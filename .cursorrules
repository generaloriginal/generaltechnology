# General Technology - Cursor Rules

## Version Management

**CRITICAL: Always update version numbers when making changes to HTML files with version numbers.**

### Version Format
- Use semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., v1.0.1)
- For frequent updates, increment the PATCH version (third number)
- Example progression: v1.0.1 → v1.0.2 → v1.0.3

### When to Update
- **ALWAYS** update the version number when:
  - Adding new features
  - Fixing bugs
  - Making UI/UX changes
  - Updating game logic
  - Any code changes to files with version numbers

### How to Update
1. Find the version element in the HTML file (usually `<div id="version">vX.X.X</div>`)
2. Increment the patch version (third number)
3. Commit the version update in the same commit as the changes, or as a separate commit immediately after

### Files with Version Numbers
- `unit-tests.html` - Contains version display at bottom of page

## Git Workflow

### Commit and Push Process
1. Make code changes
2. Update version number (if applicable)
3. Stage changes: `git add <files>`
4. Commit with descriptive message
5. Push to both remotes:
   - `git push gitlab main` (local remote)
   - `git push origin main` (GitHub Pages remote)

### Commit Messages
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include version number in commit message when updating version
- Example: "Add feature X - Update version to v1.0.2"

## Code Standards

### HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Use modern ES6+ JavaScript
- Maintain consistent code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Testing
- Test changes locally before committing
- Verify functionality in browser
- Check for console errors
